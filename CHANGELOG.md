## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Architecture & contracts.** Session-correlation design (`docs/architecture.md`) and the
  language-agnostic JSON-Schema contracts (`Signal`/`Session`/`Verdict`/`CoherenceRule`) plus the
  initial 10-rule coherence registry.
- **detector** (Python) — session correlation, the data-driven coherence engine, transparent
  noisy-or scoring with cross-layer amplification, SQLite store, and a FastAPI `/ingest` boundary.
  100% test coverage.
- **harness** (Python) — scenario runner + reproducible per-layer scoreboard (Markdown/JSON) with
  the ethics allow-list enforced in code. 100% test coverage.
- **edge** (Go) — raw ClientHello parser → JA3/JA4, session correlation, and signal forwarding.
- **collector** (TypeScript) — in-browser fingerprint + behavioral signal collection over an
  abstracted `BrowserEnv`. 100% test coverage of the pure logic.
- **Repo standards** — 2-line machine-scannable file headers (enforced), MADR ADRs, security
  posture (SECURITY.md, gitleaks, pinned actions, SBOM), supply-chain (Dependabot, license gate),
  community templates, and conventional-commit linting.
- **docs/catalog.md** — opinionated catalog of ~70 relevant projects across the arms race.
