## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Architecture & contracts.** Session-correlation design (`docs/architecture.md`) and the
  language-agnostic JSON-Schema contracts (`Signal`/`Session`/`Verdict`/`CoherenceRule`) plus the
  initial 10-rule coherence registry.
- **detector** (Python) — session correlation, the data-driven coherence engine, transparent
  noisy-or scoring with cross-layer amplification, SQLite store, and a FastAPI `/ingest` boundary.
  100% test coverage.
- **harness** (Python) — scenario runner + reproducible per-layer scoreboard (Markdown/JSON) with
  the ethics allow-list enforced in code. 100% test coverage.
- **edge** (Go) — raw ClientHello parser → JA3/JA4, session correlation, and signal forwarding.
- **collector** (TypeScript) — in-browser fingerprint + behavioral signal collection over an
  abstracted `BrowserEnv`. 100% test coverage of the pure logic.
- **Repo standards** — 2-line machine-scannable file headers (enforced), MADR ADRs, security
  posture (SECURITY.md, gitleaks, pinned actions, SBOM), supply-chain (Dependabot, license gate),
  community templates, and conventional-commit linting.
- **Live pipeline** — transparent TLS peek-proxy in the edge (captures the raw ClientHello, mints
  `ks_sid`, forwards JA3/JA4 signals), a real `vanilla` evader, and `docker-compose` wiring
  detector + edge + vanilla. Verified end-to-end (`session_id` threads socket → verdict).
- **`go-tls` evader** — uTLS-based Chrome/Firefox TLS fingerprint forging.
- **`stealth` evader (live)** — drives a real Chromium through the edge via Playwright (in the
  Playwright Docker image); the detector serves an in-page collector. Verified red-vs-blue result:
  naive automation scores `bot` (0.985, webdriver + headless tells), the stealth variant scores
  `human`.
- **Coherence registry v0.2.0** — added HTTP/2-vs-TLS, headless-UA, keystroke-entropy, and
  proxy/Tor-exit rules.
- **docs/catalog.md** — opinionated catalog of ~70 relevant projects across the arms race.
